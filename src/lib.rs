/// # Absentminded Crypto Kit
///
/// This library's purpose is to allow adding the [Absentminded Crypto Kit][1] (ACK) as a dependency
/// to Rust projects using [`oblivc`][2].
/// Since ACK's functions are written in [Obliv-C][3], this library does not have a public interface.
/// However, adding it as a dependency will make sure ACK compiles and gets linked to the project.
